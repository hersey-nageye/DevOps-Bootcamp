## ![📌](https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/32/684/684908.png) What is Linux?

Linux is a powerful, open-source operating system kernel that forms the backbone of various operating systems, commonly known as Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian). Built for flexibility, security, and high performance, Linux is extensively used in servers, cloud computing, DevOps, embedded systems, and even personal computing. Its Unix-like architecture provides stability, multi-user support, and robust networking capabilities. The open-source nature of Linux enables developers to modify, share, and contribute to its development, driving innovation and widespread adoption across industries.
